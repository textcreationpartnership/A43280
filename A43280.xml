            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ABout a Month ≈øince, I received among ≈øome other things, tho≈øe <hi>153 Chymical
Aphori≈øms,</hi> from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterdam,</hi> where they had been newly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Latin,</hi>

            <p>YO<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g> ≈øee here, my highly-e≈øteemed Friend, part of a certain Excellent Writing, dige≈øted
into brief <hi>Aphori≈øms,</hi> as a Compendium of all tho≈øe things which Phylo≈øophers are
wont to ob≈øerve, about the great Work of their Stone: Not that all things are here expounded
which belong to the Compleat De≈øcription of the Phy≈øical Tincture; for there are more things
yet behind, with which the Author intends to adorn it; ina≈ømuch as he hath determined to fortifie
the≈øe <hi>Aphori≈øms</hi> which he hath here emitted, from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Principal
Phylo≈øophers: in which Work he will accurately explain the Similitudes, Figures, and other
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure and confu≈øed manners of ≈øpeaking, which every where occur in the Writings of
Phylo≈øophers. That ≈øo at length tho≈øe things which hitherto have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb facs="tcp:53868:4"/>too intricately, and confu≈øedly by mo≈øt Writers, may appear in ≈øome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
Order. Neverthele≈øs, the principal ≈øcope of this Author, is not ≈øo much to expo≈øe or ≈øet
forth his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, as to reduce the valuable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others into order; which he
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ≈øubmitteth to the Judgment and Examination of tho≈øe, who have made a greater
Progre≈øs in the Art than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But although I know this to be the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe of the Learned Author, neverthele≈øs I chu≈øe
rather to tran≈ømit this little work to you, imperfect as it is, that you may weigh it, and
cau≈øe it to be printed, then that the Sons of Art ≈øhould any longer want this ≈ømall help;
that it may give a light to tho≈øe who err and go a≈øtray in the mid≈øt of darkne≈øs.</p>
            <p>And that the Author may judge from the event of this his labour, whether it will be worth his
Pains to emit the whole Work to the World. Farewel my good Friend, and let me continue to have a

only po≈ø≈øible,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 68. But al≈øo true;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 69. Is confirmed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of Philo≈øophers, and by Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 70. And therefore the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Medicine of Philo≈øophers,</hi> by
which this Tran≈ømutation is made, ought to have in it ≈øelf the form of common Gold or
Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 71. For if it ≈øhould want that, it could not actually introduce it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 72. Every natural Compound is di≈øtingui≈øhed from other natural Compounds, by
its own particular form, being really and actually di≈øtinct
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53868:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>from all other forms of divers natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Compounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 73. Hence, among all Sub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are determined in one of the three
Families of Nature, to wit, the Vegitable, Animal, and Mineral; there is nothing found but common
Gold, which actually containeth in it ≈øelf the form, qualities, accidents, ≈øignatures and
properties of common Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 74. Wherefore common Gold only will be the only Subject, from which the form of
Gold ought to be taken, for the Compo≈øition of the Stone of Phylo≈øophers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 75. Common Gold is only ≈øimply perfected by Nature; that is, it hath no greater
perfection than it ≈øelf wanteth, as it is Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 76. And therefore cannot communicate its perfection to other imperfect Metals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 77. Therefore if we labour in that, that common Gold ≈øhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the form
of common Gold
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53868:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>into the imperfect Metals, for their perfection, it is altogether
nece≈ø≈øary, that the common Gold ≈øhould be made more than perfect; that is, that it acquire
more Aureity and Vertue, than is required for the ≈øingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of common Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 78. No natural Compound can be made more perfect, unle≈øs it be again ≈øubjected
to the Operations of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 79. And as often as it is ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to tho≈øe, ≈øo often it acquireth a more
perfect form in its <hi>Species.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 80. Which, that it may be done, it is nece≈ø≈øary, to re≈øolve it into a matter
like to that, of which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath mo≈øt nearly produced it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 81. For naturally, there is no new Generation made, without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 82. And ≈øeeing that common Gold, as we ≈øaid above, hath its nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt ri≈øe
from an unctious and vi≈øcous Humidity,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 83. It is manife≈øt, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53868:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>not be made more than perfect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be fir≈øt re≈øolved into
≈øuch its fir≈øt matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 84. Every natural Agent a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øimilateth to it ≈øelf the Patient, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in
≈øub≈øtance, or in quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 85. Therefore, to re≈øolve common Gold into a humid, unctious and vi≈øcous
≈øub≈øtance, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an humid, unctious, and vi≈øcous Agent.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Aph.</hi> 87. Such a one as hath emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently the form of Gold, or may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by a new

            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 89. After which manner,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53868:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>things heterogeneous can never unite them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 90. And moreover, that it be more ≈øubtile, more active and ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual than
common Gold; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fir≈øt matter of Gold;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 91. Seeing that nothing can be naturally di≈ø≈øolved, but in that, and by that,
of which it is compounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 92. Whence we conclude, that no Vegitable, Animal, or Mineral Sub≈øtances, which
are not of a Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nature, (≈øuch are Stones and Salts) by any Artifice of Depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or
Preparation, or Subtilty what≈øoever, can make Common Gold more than Perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 93. Neither al≈øo Metallick Spirits, which are not of the nature of Gold; ≈øuch
are Sulphur, and Ar≈ønick, and other le≈ø≈øer or middle Minerals, which are any way compounded
of tho≈øe, although they are more ≈øubtile, and more active than Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 94. For, ≈øeeing that it is ≈øpoyled of every Sulphur, therefore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53868:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>it doth not admit the ≈øaid Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 95. Although the Vertue and Efficacy of Mineral Spirits be ≈øo great in the
Kingdom of Metals, that they cannot be altered, but by tho≈øe only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 96. Therefore that common Gold, by its re≈øolution, may be made more than
perfect, to the end, that it may bring the imperfect Metals to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; it is highly
nece≈ø≈øary to have recour≈øe to a Metallick Spirit which is of the ≈øame nature with Gold, and
therefore can unite it ≈øelf with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 97. But ≈øeeing that, from what hath been already ≈øaid, that common Gold is
nothing el≈øe but a pure Argent-Vive, perfectly dige≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Nature in the Mines of the
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 98. It followeth, that it is to be di≈ø≈øolved and rendred more than perfect, by
no Spirit, but by Argent-Vive alone, crude and indige≈øted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 99. But not the common Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent-Vine, nor that of Bodies, which is drawn from

            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 109. From what hath been ≈øaid, it is nece≈ø≈øarily inferred, that there ought
to be ≈øome Mineral af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, which may furni≈øh us with this Mercury of Phylo≈øophers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 110. Which, ≈øeeing that according to the Premi≈øes, it ought to augment the
Tincture, Fu≈øibility, and Penetration of Gold;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 111. And among Minerals there is none found which can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the colour of pale
Gold, and facilitate its Flux, and render it more penetrating, but Antimony only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 112. Therefore that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be the only Mineral, of which, and by which, the
≈øaid Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury may be obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 113. For, ≈øeeing that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony cannot communicate more Tincture to Gold, than
the natural perfection of Gold requireth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 114. And Gold, as hath been already ≈øaid, ought to be more perfectly Tinged by
the Mercury of Phylo≈øophers.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 115. This Mercury cannot be had of Antimony alone;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 116. But by it, as a <hi>Medium,</hi> from other imperfect Metallick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which abound with the Tincture of Gold;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 117. Of which ≈øort there are found only two, to wit, <hi>Mars</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 118. Whence we conclude, That of Antimony, and by its help, of <hi>Mars</hi>
al≈øo, and <hi>Venus, our Royal Men≈øtruum</hi> is to be elicited, by the work of Art and
Nature.</p>
            <p>

Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 120. <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as we have ≈øaid, is aver≈øe to the Nature of Gold, by
rea≈øon of its unctuo≈øity, adu≈øtive and impure terre≈øtreity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 121. Wherefore the ≈øaid matter of our <hi>Men≈øtruum,</hi> before all things,
is to be purged from its combu≈øtible Sulphur,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 122. That only its Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 123. This <hi>Mercury,</hi> without further Preparation, being projected upon
Gold, doth not adhere to it with profit, but like other Mineral Spirits flyeth the force of the
Fire, and leaveth the Gold unaltered, and unclean, or carrieth it up with it ≈øelf,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 124. By rea≈øon of its earthy, feculent and fugitive aquo≈øity, which is yet in
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 125. Therefore, that of this Mercury, the <hi>Mercury of Phylo≈øophers,</hi> may
be made, which can unite it ≈øelf with Gold, and render it more that perfect; it is altogether
nece≈ø≈øary, that it ≈øhould be depurated, and freed from its Feces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aph.</hi> 126. No natural Compound can be perfectly purged without its di≈ø≈øolution.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>WHereas I have Lately publi≈øhed Propo≈øals for the Printing of all the Works of that

there are divers of his Treati≈øes in the</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Tongue, which never were printed in
Latin, which I had not by me at the time of publi≈øhing the ≈øaid Propo≈øals and Specimen; ≈øo
that I could not in≈øert their Title Pages in the Specimen, as I did of the rest. Now, having
obtained the ≈øaid</hi> German <hi>Treati≈øes, and procured them to be tran≈ølated by a fit and

Book; Fir≈øt, that all the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53868:31"/>of Chymi≈øtry may know what to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more than the</hi> 44 <hi>Treati≈øes,
who≈øe Titles are in the Specimen; and ≈øecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fora≈ømuch as</hi> Glauber <hi>wrote tho≈øe

be more Open and Plain than in his former Writings; tho≈øe La≈øt Pieces of his ≈øeem to be of
another ≈øtrain, and to teach many things very openly, which the Adepts have either wholly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, or at the lea≈øt have delivered ≈øo ab≈øtru≈øely, that very few have been able to
